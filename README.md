# LocalStorage Crud using Form & Table

This project demonstrates a simple Contact Management system built with React. Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) contact entries using a form. Each entry contains a contact's name, email, and message, which are displayed in a dynamic table. The data is stored persistently in the browserâ€™s LocalStorage, ensuring the information is saved across sessions. The table allows users to edit or delete contacts, with real-time updates reflected in both the UI and LocalStorage.
